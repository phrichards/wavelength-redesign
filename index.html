					<h3>Wavelength Presents</h3>
			
					<p>
						<a href="http://wrongholemusic.bandcamp.com">WRONG HOLE</a><br>
						Douse the tires in gas and burn off on a hellish joyride. Trashcan crash, pummel drum skull smash. Lyrics spew like demon-spawn kindergarten homework, horror-trip vocals wretch, gravel guitars motor hard. (Members of Teenanger, Brutal Knights, Deadly Snakes, Comet Control, Quest For Fire)
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<a href="http://leeparadisemusic.bandcamp.com">LEE PARADISE</a><br>
						Rare performance by Dan Lee's pimp-punk project. Got that Dirty Beaches menace. Dank, rank distillation of a 4am bike ride through a weird neighbourhood. Sun's coming up, you're coming down, gotta dance anyway. (Member of Hooded Fang, Phedre, Tonkapuma, Hut)
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<a href="https://soundcloud.com/several-futures/sets/2014-demos">SEVERAL FUTURES (Tape Release!)</a><br>
						Slacker-punk with a shot of NoMeansNo and a mouthful of Slint. Shouts n' string slashes, guttural sledges of sound. Avalanche alchemy setting fire to posterity. (Members of Republic of Safety, This Mess, Danger Bay)
					</p>
			
					<p>
						<a href="http://shrinestheband.bandcamp.com/track/tuning">SHRINES</a><br>
						A filthy construction with post-hardcore edges, reaching into the the night sky of Sonic Youth. Busted up riffs and jagged kit cliffs.

					<h3>Bernice: The Wavelength Interview<br>
					(POP Montreal Edition)</h3>
					
					<p>By <a href="http://wavelengthtoronto.com/joe-strutt">Joe Strutt</a><br>
					FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2014 - 2:05PM</p>

					<img src="http://wavelengthtoronto.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/wavelog_thumb/bernice_0.jpg" alt="">
					
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Purveyors of:</span> Modern soul-hugs and subtle R'n'B caresses<br>
						<span class="bold">File next to:</span> THOMAS, Snowblink, Tropicália
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Bernice sees Robin Dann's songs brought to life by Thom Gill, Colin Fisher, Dan Fortin, Felicity Williams and Phil Melanson -- some of Toronto's most amazing musicians (members of THOMAS, Not The Wind, Not The Flag, Bahamas and more) in gloriously ascending joybursts. Given that crew's ties to the local improvised/avant scenes, it's no surprise that there's a lot of subtle tricks lurking under the soulful grooves. Joe Strutt chatted with Robin online.

						<div class="long-post">
							<p class="question">To start things off, how often do people assume that you are a person named Bernice?</p>

							<p>A lot! But I like it. Somehow it makes a lot of sense for me to answer emails, or respond to the sound person, as a person named Bernice. Makes things a little more mysterious for myself, I think. :) Snowblink told me to make leading a band into something like myth making, and that’s become a part of it, for me.</p>

							<p class="question">How did Bernice, as a band, get started? Did you have a specific sound in mind to go with material you were writing, or was it more something that emerged from the people you were working with?</p>

							<p>I did have a sound in mind, but I didn’t know how to find it. Thom helped me so much at the beginning, when all I had was a bunch of songs and the desire to make them into a record. I’ve told him this before, but when it comes to music (what we know, but also how we make it), I think of myself as a frog that skims across the water, catching the small stuff and winking at the sky, and he’s a whale underneath me breathing it all in like plankton. I guess the other band members are assorted sea creatures too, and over time it really has become something way better than just performing the songs I write live, and I do believe that our next record will allow that to come through in the sound.</p>

							<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2075316664/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1349262896/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://bernice.bandcamp.com/album/what-was-that">what was that by bernice</a></iframe>

							<p class="question">How did you first encounter these amazing musicians?</p>

							<p>I met Thom and Dan while studying at U of T about ten years ago, and Feli, Colin and Phil faded into my life in really natural ways, through friends. I felt with all three of them that when we finally met it was about time… Like meeting is almost an afterthought because I already had them in my psyche somewhere.</p>

							<p class="question">The musical relationships extend beyond Bernice in some more experimental directions. What else are you working on?</p>

							<p>ASMR buds is a small (but growing) collective I started with Colin and Felicity. We play music for the community of people whose brains tingle and buzz when they hear certain hushed sounds - a crinkling wrapper, whispered ingredients from a cereal box, ice cubes cracking in hot liquid. Our next show will be on a first Thursday of the month *hint* during the long winter *HINT* (an ASMR search on youtube will take you to some crazy places).</p>

							<p>In January, Claire Harvie and I are putting together a trio piece with Phil for the Emergents series at the Music Gallery in Toronto. Felicity curated the night and for the moment, all we can say is that we’ll be referencing the gestures we unconsciously absorb from our parents - think Dad dances, Mom laughs, soft sounds and glowing lights, spinning objects and long melodies.</p>

							<p>I think all of the musical projects that have emerged from this group of people are connected because we spend a lot of time together, and have developed a sort of image-language-aesthetic. Like so many groups of close friends, our sense of humour has developed into a pretty absurd, and absurdly specific realm that we can dip in and out of. Mostly everything we make, though, seems to come from that place. We love each other and so we inspire each other and our creative output is just another reflection of our love!</p>

							<p class="question">You've been performing some ace tunes that haven't been on a release yet. Is there a new album on the horizon?</p>

							<p>Thanks! Yes! :) :) :) More on that soon, but things are well underway on a next record.</p>

							<p class="question">You'll be representing T.O. at Wavelength's POP Montreal showcase. Is there anything else you like to do or that you'll be checking out in Montreal?</p>

							<p>I’m in Montreal a lot because Phil lives here... Maybe one last park afternoon? As for the music — I want to see Sheryl Crow so badly. Unfortunately she’s playing at almost exactly the same time as us, so I really need to figure that out.</p>

							<p class="question">If it makes you happy, it can't be that bad. Thanks for your time!</p>

							<p>You are welcome, Joe.</p>

					<h3>Zords: The Wavelength Interview</h3>
					
					<p>By Guest<br>
					SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2014 - 12:22PM</p>
					
					<img src="http://wavelengthtoronto.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/wavelog_thumb/ZORDS%20PROMO%20PIC_sml.jpg" alt="">
					
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Purveyors of:</span> Synth jams simultaneously doleful and animated, with fetching bass hooks and cherub-like vocals<br>
						<span class="bold">File next to:</span> Wild Nothing, Chromatics, New Order, Cut Copy
					</p>

						<p>Forged in the sine wave, Toronto synth-pop band Zords attempt to make you move your bod while floating through the cosmic delight that is their live performance. With driving hooks and complementary dazzling projections, I promise you will be leaving the venue highly satisfied with your night choice. If not, you can punch my face. HARD! Catch them at Wavelength 616 at the Smiling Buddha on September 13, performing with Animal Faces, ctznshp, and WHIMM.</p>

							<p class="question">Can you describe your music for those who may not have seen you yet?</p>
							
							<p>We sound like a band that would play at “Tech Noir.” You know, the nightclub that the Terminator chases Sarah Connor through in the first film.</p>

							<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1902427255/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://zords.bandcamp.com/track/dancing-eyes">Dancing Eyes by Zords</a></iframe>
							
							<p class="question">What is your method for writing songs?</p>
							
							<p>Mike writes the songs and we (Drew and Adam) take all the credit.</p>
							
							<p class="question">How long have you guys been playing music together?</p>
							
							<p>Adam: The three of us have been playing together for about three years now. It started with the previous band we played in called Mango Angle,but Drew and Mike first played together in a band they formed with a few friends during college called Beard Season. And Mike and I have been jamming since we first picked up guitars.</p>
							
							<p class="question">Who drives the van to gigs, who's most likely to stay sober to drive home?</p>
							
							<p>(Mike and Drew look at each other) Adam.</p>
							
							<p class="question">How important is having a visual component to your overall live aesthetic?</p>
							
							<p>It's very important to us. We want to engage our audience as more than just musicians. Provide them with a totally encompassing experience and really try to get them to let loose and enjoy themselves. When we can accomplish that, those are our most satisfying shows and that visual aspect really seems to help us do that.</p>

							<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=226951416/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://zords.bandcamp.com/track/dungeon-master">Dungeon Master by Zords</a></iframe>
							
							<p class="question">Adam, you are a recording engineer; Drew and Mike, you are both visual artists. Is it important that everything band-related gets done in-house and independently? Would you be willing to collaborate with other artists in the future?</p>
							
							<p>Yes, we would definitely want to collaborate with other artists in the future. There have been some discussions with friends in other bands to write some songs together or have them make guest appearances on a few tracks. Even joining us on stage during a live set for a song or two, but nothing has come to fruition just yet, hopefully in the near future. Although, Mike and Brandon (of Most People) do play together in their side project Rave Tapes, so there is some collaboration already happening.</p>
							
							<p>In regards to keeping everything in-house, it's not necessarily something we're set on. It's just more comfortable and convenient for us to do it ourselves and it gives us complete creative control over all of our work. And considering we have some of the skills and resources to do so, why not? Not to mention it's a lot cheaper when you do everything yourself.</p>
							
							<p class="question">Mike and Adam, you guys are brothers. Drew, what’s it like working with siblings? is there a Liam and Noel Gallagher thing going on?</p>
							
							<p>Drew It's like I'm watching an episode of Full House that never ends and they're playing all the characters. (laughs)</p>
							
							<p class="question">Where did the name Zords stem from?</p>
							
							<p>It was just a name that seemed to fit with the music. It has a dark and almost mechanical feel to it ,and sounds very familiar, but is not actually a real word, which makes it somewhat unique to us. It also lends a bit of nostalgia which is something we try to create with our music as well. Plus, it's short and sweet and starts with a “Z,” the best letter in the alphabet.</p>

							<p class="question">If every band in the world was looking for you to play for them, which band would each of you choose?</p>
							
							<p>Mike: I think it would be cool to have played with the Talking Heads.</p>
							
							<p>Drew: Yeah, or even Devo.</p>
							
							<p>Adam I'd be happy just being the hype man for Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. (laughs)</p>
