				<h2>WHAT IS WAVELENGTH?</h2>
					
				<h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
				
				<p>Wavelength is Toronto’s longest-running and most influential underground music forum, dedicated to presenting genre-smashing concerts and festivals, building innovative bridges within our city’s musical communities and throughout our country’s artistic landscape while challenging artists and audiences to broaden their aural perceptions.</p>
				
				<h3>Brief history:</h3>
				
				<p>Wavelength is a non-profit, artist-run arts organization, incorporated under the name Wavelength Music Arts Projects, organized and programmed by a team of seven musicians, writers and civic enthusiasts. It has been operating as a grassroots arts initiative since 2000, and incorporated as a non-profit in 2007. The Wavelength music series has a long and storied history as a forum and incubator for emerging, independent musical talent in the Toronto area, with an unparalleled track record for discovering new Canadian talent that has since gone to international success, eg. Broken Social Scene, the Arcade Fire, the Constantines, Owen Pallett, Feist, Fucked Up, Holy Fuck, The Hidden Cameras, Crystal Castles, Manitoba a.k.a. Caribou, Tokyo Police Club, Austra, METZ and Grimes.</p>
				
				<h3>Current activities:</h3>
				
				<p>Wavelength currently produces two annual festivals in Toronto, the Wavelength Music Festival in February and the ALL CAPS! Island Festival in August, as well as monthly year-round concert series in a variety of venues, in addition to workshops, artist talks and other educational, outreach events. In 2013, we have launched our inaugural Artist Incubator series, in which we will work closely with a handful of emerging artists to collaborate on special projects, recordings and touring, and provide mentorship whenever possible.</p>
				
				<h3>Public &amp; private supporters</h3>
				
				<p>Wavelength acknowledges the support of the Ontario Arts Council through its Presenter/Producer and COMPASS programs, the Toronto Arts Council through its Music program, the Canada Council for the Arts through its New Music program and the SOCAN Foundation through its Festival Grants program.</p>

				<h2>FAQ:</h2>
				
				<h4>Didn't you guys used to be at Sneaky Dee's / Ted's Wrecking Yard?</h4>
				
				<p>Yes, the Wavelength music series started out as a weekly concert series held on Sundays at Toronto music venue Ted's Wrecking Yard (RIP) in February 2000. Our original home at 549 College Street closed down in October 2001 (it's now an LCBO store), and we moved operations to Lee's Palace for a brief six month stint before relocating to Sneaky Dee's, the legendary music venue/nacho purveyor in May 2002. Sneaky's was then our home for more than seven years, until our weekly series moved to The Garrison upon its opening in October 2009, where we concluded its epic 10 year run at the Wavelength 500 Festival in February 2010.</p>
				
				<h4>I thought Wavelength was over?</h4>
				
				<p>No! Though we wrapped up our decade-long run of Sunday nights with our 500th show over three years ago, since then our concert series has transitioned into a monthly, mobile format at various venues around Toronto. We present TWO annual festivals and this year we launched our Artist Incubator pilot program and our first full-fledged tour, the Wavelength Roadshow. We're busier than ever!!</p>
				
				<h4>What happened to the zine?</h4>
				
				<p>From 2000 to 2005, the Wavelength zine was printed and distributed free of charge every month in record stores, cafes and other hangouts throughout Toronto. The zine featured photos and interviews with the acts performing each month, as well as irreverent opinion pieces, news, lists and comics. The zine was for the most part written by musicians and brought a welcome sense of humour and irony to its coverage of Toronto's burgeoning music scene. Financial and time pressures forced an end to the regular publishing of the zine, though special editions have published to coincide with more recent Wavelength Music Festivals. The zine ran online here at wavelengthtoronto.com from 2005 to 2008, when it was replaced by a group blog called the Wavelog.</p>
				
				<h4>I want to play Wavelength - how do I get booked?</h4>
				
				<p>Though the Sunday night Wavelength series finished last February after 500 amazing nights, we are still presenting monthly shows — but openings are, naturally, less common. If you are an artist interested in performing, please send us a few short words about yourself and a link to your music at contact (at) wavelengthtoronto dot com. Please do not send attachments or EPKs — they will just get deleted.</p>
				
				<h4>I want to get in contact with Wavelength about something else - how do I talk to you people?</h4>
				
				<p>For media requests, publicity materials or general info about the series or our festivals and other shows, please email contact (at) wavelengthtoronto dot com.</p>
